You are given a main function which reads the enumeration values for two different types as input, then prints out the corresponding enumeration names. Write a class template that can provide the names of the enumeration values for both types. If the enumeration value is not valid, then print unknown.

Input Format

The first line contains , the number of test cases.
Each of the  subsequent lines contains two space-separated integers. The first integer is a color value, , and the second integer is a fruit value, .

Constraints

Output Format

The locked stub code in your editor prints  lines containing the color name and the fruit name corresponding to the input enumeration index.

Sample Input

2
1 0
3 3
Sample Output

green apple
unknown unknown
Explanation

Since , there are two lines of output.

The two input index values,  and , correspond to green in the color enumeration and apple in the fruit enumeration. Thus, we print green apple.
The two input values,  and , are outside of the range of our enums. Thus, we print unknown unknown.
