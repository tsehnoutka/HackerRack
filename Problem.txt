You are given four integers: , , , . You will use them in order to create the sequence  with the following pseudo-code.

a[0] = S (modulo 2^31)
for i = 1 to N-1
    a[i] = a[i-1]*P+Q (modulo 2^31) 
Your task is to calculate the number of distinct integers in the sequence .

Input Format

Four space separated integers on a single line, , , , and  respectively.

Output Format

A single integer that denotes the number of distinct integers in the sequence .

Constraints




Sample Input

3 1 1 1
Sample Output

3
Explanation


Hence, there are  different integers in the sequence.
